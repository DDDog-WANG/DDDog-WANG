### research 

* I am interested in machine learning, especially computer vision.

* For undergraduate research, I make image classification model for biological tissue image based on bag of visual words (BoVW). If you input an tissue image, you will get the tissue's name and some similar tissue images that may be useful for doctor to find the similar treatments of some tissues disease. The originality of my research is a new methods to express image, and also get better result than the methods used before.

* For master research, now, I am doing the classification system for telescope image of cells. My Lab is AIST Collaboration Laboratory, so I do my research with some biologist of AIST to get the telescope  data. For now, I have used mask-rcnn to do segmentation that get each 1 cell from the whole image, and then creat classification model to recognize that cell is healthy or sick.
